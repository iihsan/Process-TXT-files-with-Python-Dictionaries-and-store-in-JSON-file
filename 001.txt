Web Development
Django, Flask
Python can be used to make web-applications at a rapid rate. Why is that? It is because of the frameworks Python uses to create these applications. There is common-backend logic that goes into making these frameworks and a number of libraries that can help integrate protocols such as HTTPS, FTP, SSL etc. and even help in the processing of JSON, XML, E-Mail and so much more.
